## Part 1: Analyze financial data, handle data with different year-ends

- To prepare for this session, please go to my EAA [github site](https://github.com/blucap/EEA_Python_Primer) and [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) or [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) it.
- Start the Jupyter notebook and open the file [`session_7_prep.ipynb`](https://github.com/blucap/EEA_Python_Primer/blob/master/session_7_prep.ipynb). If you use Spyder, for the Python file click [here](https://github.com/blucap/EEA_Python_Primer/blob/master/session7_prep.py).
- We will try to answer the question if the Net Income variable in the U.S. Bank Holding Company data is a stock or a flow variable.
