## Install and run Python and relevant libraries

+ Installing and initialising Python and support software, websites
  + [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) 
  + [Github](https://github.com/)
  + [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
  + Python libraries

---
## Installing python

+ Package of choice: [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#windows)
+ Installation is seamless, see demo.
  + After installation, you should run the Anaconda Navigator
  + I rely on Spyder for editing and running code
  + For education purposes use Jupyter Notebooks and Datalore

## Installing python

+ Package of choice: [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#windows)
+ Installation is seamless, see demo.
  + Note, after installation make sure you run this in the Anaconda prompt:
  + <font size="7"> `conda install anaconda-clean`</font>  
  + this helps you restore Anaconda in case something goes wrong

## Adding libraries

+ Anaconda installs most libraries for you, e.g. Pandas, Numpy
+ Once in a while you need additional libraries 
+ Three options
  + Via the dedicated Anaconda prompt
  + Via `pip install <packagename>`
  + Via the Anaconda Navigator

## Demo 1 

+ [Anaconda installation](https://vstream.au.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=585f2d6d-f096-44ef-b458-add7006066e2)
---
## Demo 2

+ [Update all packages using the Anaconda prompt](https://vstream.au.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=b3eb75da-8337-4784-b9c9-add7006066e1).
+ Although the video ended abruptly, in the end everything worked like a charm, that is, **after** a Windows restart.
